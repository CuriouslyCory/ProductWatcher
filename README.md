# NodeJS based product watcher
I bake a lot. Bread, pizza, more bread. These corona flour shortages have really put a cramp on my baking habits so instead of obsessivly mashing f5 on my favorite flour source, I built this simple watch script to check every 10 minutes and notify me via sms (a-la twilio) of any changes to the stock status.

## Installation
Just clone this repository, update the twilio-settings.js file with your own api keys, and run the script 
```$ node index.js```
